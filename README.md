# sudoku

Phase 1:

The initial idea of making a sudoku solver using simple backtracking algorithm. The input puzzle is in the form of python lists. 


Phase 2:

Taking the command-line based solver a step further and developing a GUI for the same. It visualises the working of the backtracking algorithm.
An additional functionality is the user can give numbers as input and try to solve the sudoku puzzle. If the input is entered at the incorrect place, it will not accept.
The auto-solve mode can be activated at any time by pressing the spacebar.


Phase 3 (Ongoing):

The code will be able to convert an image of the puzzle and convert it into a digital format.
This will be done in the following way - 
1. Image processing methods will be used to detect the lines and boxes.
2. Neural Network trainned on MNIST dataset will be used to identify the numbers and convert them into digital format.
3. The accurate placing of the numbers in their boxes at the correct location.


Phase 4 (In the future):

This can be deployed as an application with enhanced features and better functions.
